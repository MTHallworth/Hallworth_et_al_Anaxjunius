## ABSTRACT
Insect migration is a globally ubiquitous behavior that can involve continental-scale movements and complex life-histories. 
Apart from select species of migratory moths and butterflies, little is known about the structure of the annual cycle for migratory insects.
  Using stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of 852 wing samples from eight countries spanning 140 years, combined with 21 years of 
  citizen science data, we describe the migratory phenology and annual cycle of a large charismatic dragonfly, the common green darner 
  (<i>Anax junius</i>). We demonstrate that darners undertake complex long-distance annual migrations governed largely by temperature that 
  involve at least three generations. In early spring, the first generation makes a one-way, long distance northward migration 
  (659.46 ± 49.11 km) from the southern to northern range limits, dying after migration. A second generation makes a one-way return 
  journey to the southern range edge (680.97 ± 178.84 km), where they lay eggs and die. Finally, a third non-migratory generation emerges,
  reproducing locally giving rise to the cohort that migrates north the following spring. Our findings provide evidence that common green
  darners exhibit a novel migratory strategy, highly dependent on temperature, and intermediate between directed migrations similar to birds
  and multi-generational migration exhibited by some Lepidoptera.
